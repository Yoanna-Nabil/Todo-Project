# Todo-Project
Todo-Project using NodeJS , that have many features like authentication, authorization, error handling...........

I'd be glad to describe a Node.js todo project incorporating authentication, authorization, Mongoose for database interactions, a template engine for views, bcrypt for password hashing, and JWT for authentication:

Project Overview:

This Node.js project creates a secure todo application with the following features:

User Authentication: Users can register and log in using email and password. Passwords are securely stored using bcrypt hashing.
Authorization: Users can only access and modify their own todo items.
Database: Mongoose is used to interact with a MongoDB database to store user information and todo items.
Template Engine: A template engine like EJS or Pug is used to generate dynamic HTML views based on user data.
JWT-based Authentication: Upon successful login, a JWT (JSON Web Token) is generated and sent to the user. Subsequent requests require this token to access protected routes.
